1. Project Title: COVID-19 Vaccination and Population Analysis

Project Overview:
This project analyzes COVID-19 vaccination data in conjunction with population statistics to provide insights into vaccination trends and their 
impact across different countries and continents. Using SQL, the analysis calculates rolling totals of vaccinations, identifies the percentage of 
the population vaccinated, and highlights trends over time. This project demonstrates proficiency in data manipulation, joins, window functions, 
and grouped aggregations for meaningful insights.

Objective:
To showcase SQL skills by performing advanced data analysis on COVID-19 vaccination and population datasets, focusing on:
1. Tracking vaccination progress on a daily basis.
2. Calculating rolling totals of vaccinations for specific countries.
3. Analyzing the percentage of the population vaccinated over time.
4. Demonstrating SQL techniques like window functions, joins, and grouping.

Data Used: 
COVID-19 Vaccinations Dataset (CovidVaccinations$):
Contains daily vaccination data, including new vaccinations per day and total vaccinations.
COVID-19 Deaths Dataset (CovidDeaths$):
Includes population data, daily COVID cases, and deaths by country and continent.

2. Project Title: Data Cleaning for Housing Dataset

Project Overview: 
This project focuses on cleaning and standardizing a housing dataset using SQL. 
It demonstrates essential data cleaning techniques, such as standardizing date formats, separating address components, handling missing values, 
updating inconsistent data, and removing duplicates. The goal is to transform raw, messy data into a clean and structured format ready for analysis.

Key Objectives:
1.Standardize Date Formats:
Convert and standardize the SaleDate field into a consistent Date format.
2. Handle Missing Data:
Identify and fill missing property addresses using JOINs based on unique identifiers.
3. Split Address Fields:
Extract and separate address components (e.g., street, city, and state) into distinct columns for better usability.
4. Update Inconsistent Values:
Replace "Y" and "N" in the SoldAsVacant field with more meaningful values ("Yes" and "No").
5. Remove Duplicates:
Identify and delete duplicate rows based on specific columns (PropertyAddress, ParcelID, LegalReference).
6. Optimize the Dataset:
Drop unnecessary columns to improve data structure and reduce redundancy.
